    <h2>About {{ g.conference.full_name }}</h2>

    <p>{{ g.conference.full_name }} is taking place from October 4-5 at the Hotel Pennsylvania
    in New York City. It will feature three tracks of talks on Friday, October
    4th and Saturday, October 5th.</p>

    <h3>Background</h3>

    <p>PyGotham is a New York City based, eclectic, Py-centric conference
    covering many topics. There’s a diverse speaker list, and some things which
    will be quite different. PyGotham attracts developers of various
    backgrounds and skill levels from the New York metropolitan area and
    beyond. Activities include two full days of talks, lightning talk sessions,
    and a social event.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>

    <p>PyGotham began in 2011 and was comprised largely of the NYC Python
    community. Since then, the conference has taken place (almost) every year
    and grown significantly. While the conference has gotten larger, PyGotham
    has always been and remains a conference for developers and run by
    developers.</p>

    <h3>Who?</h3>

    <p>PyGotham is a production of <a href="https://bigapplepy.org/">Big Apple Py</a>
    and made possible by a very generous and overworked group of volunteers.
    To reach them, send a message to
    <a href="mailto:organizers@pygotham.org">organizers@pygotham.org</a>.</p>


    <h2>Who should submit? What topics are OK?</h2>

    <p>Anyone interested in speaking is encouraged to submit a proposal. There
    are no restrictions on topics, but we recommend they be of interest to
    Pythonistas. Talks will fill slots of 25 minutes and 40 minutes, including
    time for questions and answers.</p>

    <p>Everyone is encouraged to submit a proposal. We are looking for speakers
    of all different speaking and Python experience levels, from first-timers
    to experienced veterans.</p>

    <p>The audience’s experience level will be just as diverse, so feel free to
    cater your talk to a specific experience level.</p>

    <h3>Looking for Ideas?</h3>

    <p>One of the best ways to come up with an idea is to think about something
    you want to learn about. It’s a great way to learn about the topic and
    you’ll be able to share your experiences with the audience.</p>

    <p>Another great source of topics is challenges you’ve recently overcome.
    Did you recently use a unique profiler to identify a performance
    bottleneck? Perhaps you had to dive deep into a protocol or library and
    discovered something everyday users might not know. Experiences like these
    are usually full of great tips and tricks to share.</p>

    <p>Still looking for ideas? Here are some ideas to help get you started:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What’s new in web frameworks in 2019</li>
      <li>How to design software for safety and reliability</li>
      <li>Ethics of big data and software development</li>
      <li>Effective use of linters and other static analysis tools</li>
      <li>Recent changes to standard Python tools</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Also see the talks from
    <a href="https://2018.pygotham.org/talks/">2018</a>,
    <a href="https://2017.pygotham.org/talks/">2017</a>, and
    <a href="https://2016.pygotham.org/talks/">2016</a> for ideas.</p>

    <h3>Talk Selection</h3>

    <p>PyGotham’s talk review process encompasses two phases: immediately after
    the CFP closes, we will have a round of public, anonymous voting, so that
    we can get a feel for which of the talks are of greatest interest to our
    audience. After that, the program committee will assemble the final
    schedule using the ratings as a guide.</p>

    <p>We will share information on how to sign up for voting and the program
    committee on pygotham.org near the end of the CFP.</p>

    <h2>OK, I'm sold!</h2>

    <p>
    Fantastic! If you have an idea, turning it into a proposal is a
    snap -- why not <a href="{{ url_for("views.create_talk") }}">submit
    a talk</a> right now?
