subject: Your {{ g.conference.informal_name }} talk was anonymized
---
Hello,


While previewing your proposal, {{ title }}, we have identified
some information that could be used by voters or the program
committee to identify who you are. It's very important to us at
{{ g.conference.informal_name }} to have a truly anonymous
review process, so we have edited the version that will be seen
by voters and reviewers to remove this identifying information.

You can view the differences between your original proposal and the
anonymized version at {{ url_for("views.anonymized_talk", talk_id=talk_id, _external=True) }}.

If you'd like, you may edit your proposal to re-word and remove the
identifying information. This will trigger re-review by {{ g.conference.informal_name }}
staff.

Thanks!

Your friends at {{ g.conference.full_name }}
